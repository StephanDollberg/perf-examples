Perf Examples
==========

(WIP) collection of small example programs that show how perf can be used.

The examples are structured into different subdirectories corresponding to the perf subcommands. Each example comes with a makefile target that shows the perf usage.

A short blog post about the trace example can be found [here](https://dollberg.xyz/programming/2016/07/02/perf-tool/).
